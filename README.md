# MessVote 

MessVote is a hostel mess feedback web application built to understand student opinions and help mess administrators take better, data-backed decisions.

The idea for MessVote came from a simple problem: students give feedback every day, but most of it is either ignored or too unstructured to act upon. This project aims to bridge that gap by collecting feedback in a structured way and gradually adding intelligence to interpret it automatically.

## Version 1 (Current)

Version 1 focuses on building a stable and usable feedback system.  
It establishes the product foundation before adding any intelligence.

Current features include:
- Separate login flows for students and administrators
- Meal-wise feedback and rating collection
- Storage of feedback data for analysis
- Basic admin dashboards to view ratings and suggestions

This version mainly serves as a data collection and validation layer.

## Version 2 (ongoing)

Version 2 will extend MessVote with data analytics and machine learning capabilities to reduce manual effort for administrators.

Planned improvements include:
- NLP-based classification of written feedback into complaint categories
- Automatic detection of recurring issues from rating trends
- Weekly summary insights highlighting major problems
- Dish-wise performance tracking over time

The goal of Version 2 is to convert raw student feedback into clear, actionable insights.
